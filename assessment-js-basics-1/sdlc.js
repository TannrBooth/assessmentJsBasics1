// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = "Based on the plan that was established, determine what resources will be needed for this project. Which language stacks should be used, how many devs would be needed for each part of the project, how much time you estimate the project will take, etc."

const design = "Before you write any code, visualize your project in necessary ways. Use flow charts, sketches, etc. to illustrate the logic of your project, the different sections that can be tackled separately, and any other ideas that need to be strongly communicated on a high level."

const implementation = "This is when the coding happens. Use all the principles learned in DevMountain to create a fantastic project and repo it correctly so that a team can accurately keep up with/contribute to your project."

const testingIntegration = "Test your code. Run it in ways that you might expect to break it to find fixable errors. Review and QA your code very carefully. Integrate your code into your existing systems/frameworks and test it in that context too."

const maintain = "Keep track of the changes being made around your code and develop a plan to update your code accordingly. If your existing systems/frameworks update, update your code. Repeat much of the testing/integration process when updates are scheduled to see what needs to be updated. Also make sure the information in your project is updated and accurate."
